# ParkourGhost

**Requires Parkour!**
â€‹


**ParkourGhost** is an add-on for [Parkour](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/parkour.23685/) that lets you race against a ghost of your best run, challenging yourself to beat your own record.
It's inspired by Time Trials from Mario Kart.

It only works from 1.21 to 1.21.4 since I used NMS from this version specifically because this project was mainly a way for me to learn NMS development. I may consider using Protocollib to make it cross-version in the future.

## Features:
- Client-side npc (only you can see your ghost)
- Configurable

## Command:
- /parkourghost play [parkour_name] - Challenge your best time on this parkour with your ghost.
- /parkourghost reload - Reload config. (For admin)

## Permission:
parkourghost.admin - Reloading the config.
